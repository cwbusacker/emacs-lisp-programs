# emacs-lisp-programs

All of the included programs in emacs-lisp were programs written for
CS237 (Discrete Mathematics). Much of the work accomplished in Discrete
Mathematics was accomplished in teams.

The password security program was originally written in c++ by a fellow
classmate. I converted the code into emacs-lisp in about 30 minutes.

The vigenere cipher was originally written by a fellow classmate. I simply
added some of my own features to it.
